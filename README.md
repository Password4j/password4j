Password4j is a Java utility package for hashing and checking passwords with different [Key derivation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function) (KDFs) 
and [Cryptographic hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) (CHFs).

Algorithms can be configured **programmatically** or through a **property file** in your classpath <sup>see [Configuration section](#Configuration)</sup>.

The configurations are mostly dependent on your environment. Password4j delivers a **tool that can create
a set of optimal parameters** based on the system performance and the desired maximum computational time <sup>see [Performance section](#Performance)</sup>.

The library fully supports **[BCrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)**, **[SCrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt)** and **[PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)** 
and can produce and handle cryptographic **[salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29)** and **[pepper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_%28cryptography%29)**.


# Installation
Password4j runs on **Java 8**, **Java 9**, **Java 10** and **Java 11** by any vendor. It is supported by **Android API 26+** as well.

The artifacts are deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/).
## ![Maven](https://i.imgur.com/2TZzobp.png?1) Maven 
Add the dependency of the latest version to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.password4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>password4j</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## ![Gradle](https://i.imgur.com/qtc6bXq.png?1) Gradle
Add to your `build.gradle` module dependencies:
```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.password4j:password4j:1.4.0'
}
```

## ![Scala SBT](https://i.imgur.com/Nqv3mVd.png?1) Scala SBT 
Add to the managed dependencies of your `build.sbt` the latest version:
```shell script
libraryDependencies += "com.password4j" % "password4j" % "1.4.0"
```

# Usage
Password4j provides three main features.

## Hash the password
Here it is the easiest way to hash a password with a CHF (BCrypt in this case)

```java
Hash hash = Password.hash(password).withBCrypt();
```

Salt and pepper may be optionally added to the builder (PBKDF2 in this case): 

```java
// PBKDF2 with salt 12 bytes long (randomly generated).
Hash hash = Password.hash(password).addRandomSalt(12).withPBKDF2();

// PBKDF2 with a chosen salt.
Hash hash = Password.hash(password).addSalt(salt).withPBKDF2();

// PBKDF2 with chosen salt and pepper.
Hash hash = Password.hash(password).addSalt(salt).addPepper(pepper).withPBKDF2();

// Custom PBKDF2 (PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA512, 64000 iterations and 512bit length).
Hash hash = Password.hash(password).with(PBKDF2Function.getInstance(Hmac.SHA512, 64000, 512));

```
The same structure can be adopted for the other CHFs, not just for PBKDF2.


## Verify the hash
With the same ease you can verify an hash
```java
boolean verified = Password.check(password, hash).withBCrypt();
```

Salt and pepper may be optionally added to the builder (PBKDF2 in this case): 

```java
// Verify with PBKDF2.
boolean verification = Password.check(password, hash).withPBKDF2();

// Verify with PBKDF2 and manually provided salt.
boolean verification = Password.check(password, hash).addSalt(salt).withPBKDF2();

// Verify with PBKDF2 and manually provided salt and pepper.
boolean verification = Password.check(password, hash).addSalt(salt).addPepper(pepper).withPBKDF2();
```
 The same structure can be adopted for the other algorithms, not just for PBKDF2. Take in account that BCrypt and SCrypt store the salt
 inside the hash, so the `addSalt()` method is not needed.


## Update the hash
When a configuration is not considered anymore secure  you can
refresh the hash like this:
```java
HashUpdate update = Password.check(password, hash).update().withBCrypt();

if(update.isVerified())
{
    Hash newHash = update.getHash();
}
```
Or if you want to switch from a CHF to another one:
```java
PBKDF2Function pbkdf2 = AlgorithmFinder.getPBKDF2Instance();
HashUpdate update = Password.check(password, hash).update().withSCrypt(pbkdf2);

if(update.isVerified())
{
    Hash newHash = update.getHash();
}
```

## Unsecure Algorithms
Many systems may still use unsecure algorithms for storing the passwords, like [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) or [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2).
You can easily migrate to stronger algorithms with Password4j
```java
MessageDigestFunction md = MessageDigestFunction.getInstance("SHA-256");
HashUpdate update = Password.check(password, hash).update().withSCrypt(md);

if(update.isVerified())
{
    Hash newHash = update.getHash();
}
```

## Security of Strings
`String`s are immutable objects and they are stored in the String Pool, a location in the heap memory.
Since you do not have control on the Garbage Collector, an attacker that has access to the memory could read the password
just before you use it as input for Password4j. Even after this, the `String` may be still persisted in memory
until the garbage collection occurs.

It is always recommended to use `char[]` instead of `String` <sup>(where possible - If we're talking of a web application, 
most web containers will pass the password into the `HttpServletRequest` object in plaintext as `String`)</sup>.

For this reason Password4j provides a `SecureString` class that alleviates this problem. The provided
`char[]` is wrapped around `SecureString` and it is never converted into a `String` during the process.

You can erase the underlying `char[]` with `clear()` method.
```java
SecureString secure = new SecureString(new char[]{...});

Passowrd.hash(secure).withBCrypt();
Password.check(secure, hash).withBCrypt();

secure.clear();
// At this point the underlying char[] = {\0, \0, \0, ...}
```
In addition to this, you may want to clean the original `char[]`.
With the following code even the source is zeroed:
```java
char[] password = {...}
SecureString secure = new SecureString(password, true);

// At this point password = {\0, \0, \0, ...}
```
The pepper can be expressed as `SecureString` as well.

# Configuration
Password4j makes available a portable way to configure the library.

With the property file `psw4j.properties` put in your classpath, you can define the parameters of all the supported CHFs or just the CHF(s) you need.
Alternatively you can specify a custom path with the system property `-Dpsw4j.configuration`

```shell script
java -Dpsw4j.configuration=/my/path/to/some.properties ...
```

Here's a basic configuration (please do not use it in production, but instead start a benchmark session in your target environment<sup>see [Performance section](#Performance)</sup>)
```properties
### PBKDF2
# with HMAC-SHA256
hash.pbkdf2.algorithm=SHA256
# 64000 iterations
hash.pbkdf2.iterations=64000
# derived key of 256bit 
hash.pbkdf2.length=256

### BCrypt
hash.bcrypt.minor=b
# logarithmic cost (cost = 2^12)
hash.bcrypt.rounds=12

### SCrypt
# N
hash.scrypt.workfactor=16384
# r
hash.scrypt.resources=16
# p
hash.scrypt.parallelization=1

### Legacy
# algorithm
hash.md.algorithm=SHA-512
# append/prepend salt
hash.md.salt.option=append
```
Additionally you can define here your shared pepper
```properties
global.pepper=AlicePepper
```
and use it like this
```java
// Hash
Password.hash("password").addPepper().withSCrypt();

// Verify
Password.check("password", "hash").addPepper().withSCrypt();
```

[SecureRandom](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html) may be instantiated through `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()`
```properties
global.random.strong=true
```
but make sure that your JVM supports it and it points to a non-blocking source of entropy, otherwise you may experience huge performance drops<sup>see [SecureRandom](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html#getInstanceStrong--)</sup>.

# Performance
<sup>This tool must be used in the target system because performances may vary on different environments.</sup>

Password4j is delivered with a tool that helps the developers to choose the right parameters for a specific CHF.

The class `SystemChecker` can be used to find these optimal values.

Here's an example on how to configure PBKDF2:
```java
Hmac algorithm = Hmac.SHA256;
int length = algorithm.bits();
long maxTimeInMilliseconds = 150;

int iterations  = SystemChecker.findIterationsForPBKDF2(maxTimeInMilliseconds, algorithm, length);

System.out.println("Iterations: " + iterations);
```

A similar approach can be used for BCrypt:
```java
long maxTimeInMilliseconds = 150;

int rounds = SystemChecker.findRoundsForBCrypt(maxTimeInMilliseconds);

System.out.println("Rounds: " + rounds);
```

And SCrypt:
```java
int r = 16;
int p = 1;
long maxTimeInMilliseconds = 150;

int N = SystemChecker.findWorkFactorForSCrypt(maxTimeInMilliseconds, r, p);
r = SystemChecker.findResourcesForSCrypt(maxTimeInMilliseconds, N, p);

System.out.println("N: " + N + ", r: " + r);
```
