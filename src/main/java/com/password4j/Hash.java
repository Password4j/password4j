/**
 * This class contains all the information computed after
 * calculating a cryptographic hash.
 * <p>
 * The same {@link HashingFunction} used to generate the hash
 * is used to verify the plain password; in addition <i>cryptographic
 * seasoning</i> such as salt and pepper are stored in this object.
 * <p>
 * An hash is the product of a one-way function that maps data of arbitrary size to
 * fixed-size values; it is called hashing function (HF).
 * This class represent hashes generated by cryptographic hash function (CHF),
 * where each function has the following properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>it is deterministic, meaning that the same message always results in the same hash</li>
 * <li>it is quick to compute the hash value for any given message</li>
 * <li>it is infeasible to generate a message that yields a given hash value</li>
 * <li>it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value</li>
 * <li>a small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value
 * appears uncorrelated with the old hash value</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process.
 * As the salt is unique for every user, an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt,
 * rather than being able to calculate a hash once and compare it against every stored hash.
 * <p>
 * A pepper can be used in additional to salting to provide an additional layer of protection.
 * It is similar to a salt, but has two key differences:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The pepper is shared between all stored passwords, rather than being unique like a salt.</li>
 * <li>The pepper is not stored in the database, unlike the salts.</li>
 * </ul>
